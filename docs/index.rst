Welcome to Helium's documentation!
==================================

Helium is a Python library for automating web sites. It is based on
`Selenium-python <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/>`_.
Selenium is great, but difficult to use. Helium wraps around Selenium to give
you a simpler API. Helium's name comes from being a lighter chemical element
than Selenium.

For a quick overview of Helium's features, please see
`the project home page <https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium>`_.
Here, in the documentation, you will find a more comprehensive reference.
