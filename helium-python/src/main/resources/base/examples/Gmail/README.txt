This example is the result of a thorough comparison of Helium vs. pure Selenium
for web automation. It automates the sending and receiving of emails through
Gmail's web interfaces, once with Helium and once with Selenium. The results
are pretty striking: The Helium implementation (gmail_helium.py) is 67% shorter
 - and much easier to read - than the Selenium implementation
(gmail_selenium.py).
